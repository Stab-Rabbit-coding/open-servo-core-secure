# osc servo transport — the deadline-pipelined receiver

The servo-side transport of the osc-native protocol: how a sub-$0.20 MCU
with no input capture and no crystal turns break-framed wire traffic into
dispatched instructions and on-grid replies. Companion pillars:
`osc-native-protocol.md` (the wire; §3.4 is the two-signal fault
contract), `driver-pattern.md` (the layering). `[Fn]` cites the measured
foundation in `osc-native-protocol.md` §11.

Code is authoritative; when this doc and the code disagree, fix the doc.

## 1. Architecture in one paragraph

All byte movement is hardware. The CPU never receives or transmits a
byte: DMA writes every received byte into a circular ring, DMA streams
every reply out of buffers and the control table, and a DMA-fed SPI
engine computes every CRC. Software is pure state machines — `Framer`,
`Chain`, `TxEngine`, and the clock tracker — composed by `ServoBus`,
driven by exactly two interrupt vectors at one priority, whose only jobs
are to compute two kinds of numbers — *where* frames sit in the ring, and
*when* something is due — and to react to two kinds of events: "a break
happened" (the USART's length-qualified LIN break detector) and "it is
time now" (one tick comparator, multiplexed over every deadline the
transport has).

## 2. Hardware ledger

Every hardware resource the transport touches, and its duty cycle:

| resource        | role                                             | budget/event |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| USART1          | half-duplex wire; HDSEL, no self-echo (F9)       | —            |
| USART1 vector   | PFIC HIGH. (a) LBD = break wake (length-qualified ≥10-bit low; flag-selective write-0 clear at entry, never a DATAR read; FE/NE/ORE have no interrupt enable — they latch silently, §7); (b) TC = TX arm drained | break body ~1 µs; TC body ~2–4 µs/arm |
| SysTick CNT/CMP | the transport clock (48 MHz, 32-bit) + the ONE comparator | — |
| SysTick vector  | PFIC HIGH. Deadline mux: framer A/B, covered, chain trigger — and dispatch, inline (every class except verdict-first runs at the covered checkpoint or the fast path, §6) | arithmetic slots ~1–5 µs; dispatch bodies ~10–70 µs |
| DMA1 CH5        | USART1 RX → 512 B ring, circular, silent (no IRQ); **VERYHIGH, alone atop the ladder** (§7) | zero CPU |
| DMA1 CH4        | TX arms → USART1 DR (header, snapshot payload, CRC tail); HIGH | zero CPU; TC surfaces as USART TC |
| DMA1 CH3        | CRC feeds → SPI1 DR, 16-bit halfwords (RX span straight from the ring); MEDIUM, below CH6 | zero CPU, ~0.36 µs/B engine time |
| SPI1            | CRC-16/ARC coprocessor (16-bit LSB-first, bitrev16 at the register), accumulates across feeds | runs ~8× wire speed (F6) |
| DMA1 CH6        | snapshot copy → the 256 B snapshot buffer (reply payloads only — RX CRC feeds the ring directly); HIGH, above CH3 | ~0.125 µs/B, zero CPU |
| DMA1 CH1        | ADC sample set → buffer; DMA HIGH (wins HIGH ties by channel number); TC vector = motor kernel tick at PFIC LOW | ~10 µs body |
| PC0 CNF         | drive discipline: open-drain listening / push-pull TX window | flipped at trigger/release |
| main loop       | deferred reboot poll + rescue line sampler (protocol §9.1: line pin + CH5 NDTR once per wfi wake — the break detector latches only at a span's END, so the slow loop is the only observer of a pulse in progress) | cold path; sampler ~0.3 µs/wake |

Buffered boards (the default config; the `half-duplex` feature selects
the direct wire) swap the wire rows: USART1 runs plain full duplex (no
HDSEL, RX on PC1 through the 74LVC2G241's mute-gated receive buffer), and
the PC0-CNF flip becomes the TX_EN (PC2) level — high claims the wire and
mutes RX, low releases. Every discipline in this doc (the no-DATAR rule,
F9 no-echo) holds identically; only the claim/release lines in `TxWire`
differ.

PFIC preemption is two-level (IPRIOR bit 7). USART1 + SysTick share HIGH
and therefore serialize against each other; LOW holds only the motor
kernel (DMA1_CH1 = 22), which HIGH preempts and which runs in the wire
gaps between frames. Free and reserved: TIM2 (reserved: future encoders),
TIM1 (motor PWM), SW (14), I2C1_EV (30), I2C1_ER (31).

**Kernel ticks under load — measured and accepted.** Everything-at-HIGH
means transport work preempts the kernel, and a kernel tick that pends
while a ≥50 µs HIGH chunk runs coalesces with the next one (the PFIC pend
bit is one bit). Silicon, against a 20.11 kHz idle tick baseline: tick
loss ≈ 1.2–1.4× the transport-HIGH duty — 14% under a sustained 9-frame
zero-gap flood (~11% duty), 23% under a 21-frame flood (~17% duty).
Latency stays bounded (the longest HIGH chunk is ~60–80 µs ≈ 1–2 ticks);
ticks are never starved outright. Accepted because the duty profile that
loses ticks is rare in practice: config sessions run torque-off (kernel
idle by definition), and the production hot loop is a few small GWRITEs +
COMMIT + GREAD per cycle — short bursts, wire-gapped, single-digit duty.
A use case that sustains heavy bus duty under live control is the signal
to revisit (hardware-counted ticks, or an isolation lane).

## 3. One exchange, tick by tick (ping at 1M; byte-time = 10 µs)

```
t=0    break's wire end. DMA has already ringed the 0x00. LBD ISR (~2 µs) —
       a pure wake: the framer resolves from ring data and projects deadline
       A = now + 3 byte-times at wire pace + ½ byte for the break tail
       [F5]. No timestamp is recorded.
t=10/20/30  ID, LEN, INST land in the ring by DMA. CPU idle.
t=35   deadline A (SysTick): header parse + validate → footprint 6, frame
       end computable. A ping's CRC-covered span IS its header, so the
       covered checkpoint fires from this same wake:
         · packet_end FROZEN by ring cadence: now + missing(2)·byte-times
           (+ the 1.6% drift pad) — `now` and the cursor advance together,
           so ISR lag cancels and the estimate is late by under a
           byte-time, never early.
         · CRC feed of the covered span starts (CH3 arm, ~1 µs of CPU)
         · DISPATCH (inline, at HIGH): decode + dispatch run NOW, the
           reply is built and staged into the TX engine — all before the
           frame has ended. The verdict at deadline B will SEND or
           DON'T-SEND it; the work is already done either way.
       Deadline B armed at the frozen packet_end, exactly.
t=40/50  the two wire-CRC bytes land. SPI engine finishes the covered span
       long before (4 B ≈ 1.5 µs). CPU idle again.
t≈55   deadline B (SysTick): the verdict — poll CRC result (ready) == wire
       CRC → SEND: chain sequences the staged reply, trigger due at
       packet_end + reply gap (12 µs, fixed at every baud). Body is a few µs —
       the work already happened.
t≈67   trigger (SysTick): INST finalized, PC0 → push-pull, break sent, first
       DMA arm armed. Status break falls. TX CRC is computed by the same SPI
       engine IN PARALLEL with transmission and patched into the final arm.
t=…    per-arm TC ISRs stream the remaining arms; final TC releases the wire
       and applies any deferred id/baud config.
```

Measured: 30.4 µs from instruction end to status break fall (§10). The
estimate chain above — reply-gap grid plus sub-byte estimate lateness —
accounts for roughly half; the remainder is trigger-body, break commit,
and ISR-entry overheads.

## 4. Why this is fast — first principles

1. **Dispatch before the verdict — the spine.** Dispatch never waits on
   the CRC. It runs the moment the covered span is ringed (frontier) or
   the frame is complete (backlog), and STAGES its effects; the CRC
   verdict then gates those effects, never the work. This is not an
   optimization layered on a "safe" path — it IS the default, for every
   class. The alternative (a non-dispatching path that schedules a CRC
   check and blocks on the result before doing any work) spends ~5–7 µs
   of HIGH per frame spinning on a finished engine, and in a zero-gap
   burst those spins stack onto the burst-cycle critical path and widen
   break-delivery lag — so no such path exists. The verdict gates two
   effect kinds: the **wire effect** (a staged reply — SEND on pass,
   DON'T-SEND on fail) and the **table effect** (staged writes — COMMIT
   on pass, REVERT on fail). Ping/read stage only a wire effect; a
   NOREPLY write only a table effect; a reply-bearing write both, under
   one verdict.
2. **Work hides under wire time.** The dispatch window (covered
   checkpoint → frame end) runs decode + dispatch + reply build while the
   last two CRC bytes are still in flight. Deadline B — the only step on
   the reply's critical path — is reduced to "poll a finished CRC and arm
   the trigger". The reply rides the reply-gap grid, not the dispatch
   time.
3. **The verdict is almost always PASS.** Dispatch bets the frame passes
   CRC. On a clean bus that is ~100% of frames; the loser (a corrupted
   frame) pays a revert + don't-send, which is off the happy path by
   definition — and the frame-position ladder is untouched by it (§5), so
   the hunt just starts one hop later, on corrupt frames only, inside the
   host's retry contract.
4. **Hardware CRC in both directions, in parallel.** RX: fed at the
   covered checkpoint (or publish), chewing while the CRC bytes fly,
   polled at the verdict. TX: fed per arm, patched into the trailing arm
   before DMA reaches it. The CPU never computes or waits a full CRC.
5. **Zero hops, everywhere.** Every stageable class (ping/read/gread,
   write/gwrite) dispatches inline at HIGH — each stage hands off by
   falling through within one ISR invocation or the next event's entry,
   no cross-priority round-trip. The kernel-side cost is the measured,
   accepted tick coalescing in §2.
6. **Copy-once TX.** Reply payloads are DMA-snapshotted once
   (~0.125 µs/B, fire-and-forget) and streamed from the snapshot by both
   the wire and the CRC — snapshot-consistent reads for the price of one
   copy hidden under reply gap (protocol §4.2).
7. **One comparator, muxed.** Every deadline (framer A/B/covered, chain
   trigger, rescue) folds onto SysTick CMP with pend-on-past semantics;
   the drain loop consumes every slot due at the same wake.
8. **The single-context CRC engine needs no arbitration protocol.** TX
   generation and RX validation share one engine safely because both run
   at HIGH — ownership is serialized by the PFIC, for free.

## 5. Position and time from the stream

The transport's central design rule: **position is derived from the
stream, never sampled at ISR entry; times come from data-cadence
projections, never wake arrival.**

The rationale is staleness, not latency. A handler that samples the ring
cursor at ISR entry and classifies the event by `ring[cursor−1]` reads
the wrong byte whenever service lags the wire by a byte-time — and at 3M
(3.33 µs/byte) any dispatch body guarantees that lag, while two pended
breaks coalesce into one PFIC entry. The failure is silent: the cursor
has moved past the break byte, the test reads frame data, the framer
ignores the "garble", and a fully intact frame in the ring is never
anchored. A queue of cursor snapshots inherits the same staleness at
capture time — entry delay ≥ 1 byte-time makes the snapshot stale before
it is stored. Latency merely amplifies staleness; deriving position from
the stream removes the staleness, and latency stops meaning loss.

### 5.1 The break wake carries nothing

The break wake carries neither position nor time. It is a pure wake, and
its handler does only the bounded wire work: staged-reply kill (from
which broadcast-ENUM replies are exempt — colliding is their contract,
and they ride a UID-keyed slot delay so twin matchers don't collide in
undetectable unison, protocol §9.2) and chain suspend. Every aim and
estimate is instead projected from live ring state at each resolve:

```
aim / estimate = now + missing·tpb (+ span·tpb ≫ 6 drift pad)
```

`now` and the cursor advance together, so ISR delivery lag — the thing a
wake timestamp inherits wholesale (a 60 µs-late wake makes the reply
60 µs late) — cancels out of the projection. The error is bounded by one
byte-time plus one wake latency and is always on the LATE side: a byte
counted as missing can only finish sooner than assumed, so a reply grid
measured from the estimate never fires into its own frame's tail (the
reply-gap safety property, sim-pinned). The reply-grid estimate is frozen
at the covered checkpoint, where missing ≤ 2 makes it tightest. Aims are
self-pacing for free: a stalled wire re-projects at each wake ≥ one
byte-time out, so no recheck/park budget machinery exists; the
64-byte-time progress-idle horizon (the starve horizon) is the sole death
authority. One epsilon survives, on header aims only: the break rings at
its wake point ~4 bit-times before the line rises [F5], so the first data
byte sits that far outside the byte cadence.

### 5.2 The ring is the queue

Frames are contiguous: `next anchor = anchor + footprint` (stream
continuity). The cursor is read only at provably-quiet bootstrap moments —
boot (position 0 by construction) and rescue confirm (a held-low line
delivers no start edges, so the cursor is still); the ring is armed once
and never reloaded. From then on:

- **Fast path (successor available).** If newer activity exists beyond
  the current frame's computed end — its end byte is ringed and more
  followed — then every byte of this frame is already present. Resolve it
  purely from ring data: header, covered, CRC, dispatch, in one pass, no
  deadlines. A backlog of N frames is walked N frames at a time with zero
  scheduling; the 512 B ring (≥ 15 hot-loop frames) is the queue, and it
  cannot "drop" an entry the way a snapshot queue can.
- **Scheduled path (newest frame only).** The frame still arriving rides
  the deadline pipeline: A (header) → covered checkpoint (dispatch, §6) →
  B (verdict), every deadline a ring-cadence projection.

### 5.3 Garble dies by data only

Per the fault contract (protocol §3.4), no frame is dropped, killed, or
rejected on wake evidence — wake-time observations (service-time cursors,
latched re-fires) lie under exactly the conditions a busy fleet produces:
coalesced or lagged break service at high ISR occupancy, and latched-flag
re-fires after NOREPLY frames (nothing transmits, so nothing retires a
flag). A death decision derived from them plants itself inside live
frames. Data is the only death authority: a phantom candidate born from
garble is killed by its footprint-fill CRC verdict or by the starve
horizon — never by fault position. The cost is bounded, documented
recovery latency (the host pacing rule, protocol §3.4) instead of
fault-speed phantom kills; a phantom's CRC rejection flips the hunt on,
and the hunt converges from ring data.

Corruption recovery is bounded: a corrupted LEN mis-strides the ladder;
the next resolution finds no `0x00` at the expected anchor (or the frame
fails CRC) → drop + count, and the ladder re-verifies at every following
boundary. Anchors are parity-free (protocol §3.2), so recovery needs no
ring reload, only the next break's arrival. Loss is bounded to ≤ 2 frames
per corruption event; the host's timeout+retry contract closes the loop.

## 6. Instruction classes

The class split is *stageability* — whether an instruction's effects can
be staged behind the CRC verdict:

- **Stageable — PING/READ/GREAD/WRITE/GWRITE.** Dispatch inline at HIGH
  at the covered checkpoint (frontier) or the resolve wake (backlog); the
  CRC feed chews underneath. The verdict at the frame end gates the
  staged effects: SEND/DON'T-SEND of a reply, COMMIT/REVERT of a table
  write.
- **Verdict-first — COMMIT/MGMT.** Their effects cannot be staged (COMMIT
  applies the whole buffer; MGMT reboots), so the CRC is checked FIRST
  and dispatch runs only on a pass. Rare, short frames — the ~2 µs
  blocking CRC poll is affordable where staging isn't possible.

Backpressure is structural: at most one pending-verdict frame exists at a
time (the pending frame IS the frontier), so the single staging slot and
the single CRC accumulator are never contended. The kernel-isolation
question is settled by measurement instead of structure: dispatch bodies
preempt the kernel and coalesce ticks in proportion to bus duty (§2),
which the intended duty profiles make negligible.

## 7. The DMA priority ladder and receive-side discipline

The receive side's one hazard window is the RX-DMA drain of an inbound
byte racing the CPU: if the drain lags, the break wake enters with the
ring cursor not yet advanced past the byte — the resolver sees a
caught-up ladder and stays silent (no-reply). In isolation the drain is
effectively instantaneous versus the interrupt (zero
byte-still-undrained entries observed across soaks at 1M and 3M); the
window opens ONLY under DMA1-arbiter contention, where a competitor
delays the CH5 drain — 22% of frames at a moderate competing burst, 94%
at a heavy one. The arbiter preempts **per-beat** (RX stays clean even
against a 256-transfer competitor once it outranks it), so RX alone at
the top bounds its drain wait to a single in-flight transfer — a couple
of cycles, far under interrupt entry latency — regardless of the
competitor's burst length.

So the guarantee is the priority ladder, not a software mitigation:

- **VERYHIGH:** CH5 RX — alone at the top.
- **HIGH:** CH1 ADC, CH4 TX, CH6 snapshot (ADC wins the HIGH ties by
  channel number, keeping its interleave ahead of the copy).
- **MEDIUM:** CH3 CRC feed — below CH6 so a reply copy is written before
  the feed reads it.

With RX on top the break byte is always ringed before `on_break` reads
ring state, so the framer needs no promise machinery from the wake.
Silicon: 25k/25k zero-gap hot loops at 2M and 3M with zero
no-reply/stale.

**The no-DATAR rule.** The ladder protects only the byte already in RDR.
A CPU DATAR read while a byte is mid-reception additionally kills the
byte in the SHIFTER — no flag, no ring entry, no NDTR count — and no
drain priority can help, because the byte dies before a DMA request ever
exists. The window scales with bit time: unhittable at 2M/3M, systematic
at 1M under one alignment. So nothing on the receive side ever touches
DATAR. Silicon: 12k/12k plain floods at 1M and 0.5M with no RX-path DATAR
read, versus 44/12k with one present.

**LBD is the only receive interrupt.** Its clear at entry is a
flag-selective STATR write — all bits 1 except LBD's 0, a constant write,
never a read-modify-write (an RMW races concurrently-setting rc_w0 bits
and arms the SR half of the error-clear pair). The per-character error
flags (FE/NE/ORE) are never serviced: EIE stays 0 from boot, so a latched
error flag pends nothing, storms nothing, and needs no retire protocol.
The flags self-clear incidentally when ordinary traffic pairs a STATR
read with the drain's DATAR access, but nothing observes or depends on
it; at most they may be polled from a cold path as line-noise telemetry
(protocol §3.4).

The rationale for waking on LBD rather than the error flags is
first-principles: the error flags are latched, positionless, and
coalescing, so a wake built on them shall be throttled against garble
storms (wrong-baud traffic heard as continuous framing errors), and any
mute needs a restore path that itself cannot be starved — a structural
liability. A wake that never needs muting deletes the problem: LBD is
length-qualified (only a genuine ≥10-bit dominant span sets it), so real
errors never interrupt at all, and their consequences surface exactly
where data-driven handling already looks (§5.3). Silicon: law breaks
2000/2000 intact with the write-0 clear running mid-traffic; zero vector
entries across framing-error injection and high-baud garble; reception
perfect with FE latched throughout, entries == breaks for the whole run.

## 8. Clock discipline

Chain snoop is servo→servo (protocol §9.3): slot k>0 times its reply off
the predecessor's snooped status frame, so the clock budget is
pairwise-HSI — two uncalibrated RC oscillators against each other.
Factory spread (7k+ ppm measured across five chips) garbles snooped
status tails at 3M; trimming is what makes high-baud chains work. The
host owns the only crystal on the bus, so it is the syntonization root:
the servo measures the host's cadence and slews HSITRIM toward it.

Two estimators feed the trim loop, both built on break-wake stamps at
frame boundaries — hardware-anchored and same-ISR-flavor, so entry
latency cancels in every pair. (Mid-frame progress stamps do not have
this property: they are whole-byte-quantized with software-chosen phase,
and they need frames far longer than real hot-loop traffic provides.)
These stamps are the one sanctioned exception to §5's no-wake-time rule —
the trim machinery's entire subject is the break-service stamp itself,
and it is gated, paired, and baseline-anchored accordingly (protocol
§3.4, §9.3).

- **Absolute, rarely — MGMT CAL.** A broadcast instruction announcing N
  breaks spaced exactly T µs; the servo stamps `deadline.now()` at each
  break-wake entry, gates each gap at |Δ−T| ≤ T/16, and trims off the
  sum. ~±260 ppm from 8 × 400 µs gaps. Fired at boot (≥2 trains — the
  first identifies the chip's step effect, protocol §9.3 boot guidance)
  and at host-known events, not on a timer. Break decode is
  threshold-free across the full HSITRIM throw, so CAL also rescues a
  railed servo.
- **Differential, continuously — chain pairs.** Break-wake stamps of
  adjacent host instructions (GWRITE→COMMIT seams):
  `err = measured − footprint·tpb = seam + drift·span`. The host's
  queuing seam is unknown but stationary; a baseline captured right after
  each trim application subtracts it, so windows read pure drift. Any
  constant — seam, detector latch offset, ISR flavor residue — dies in
  the subtraction; only changes survive, and the sanity band catches
  non-thermal jumps.

Both feed the `TrimLoop`: `steps = round(err / step_effect)`, clamped ±4;
round-to-nearest IS the deadband. The step effect is self-measured (chip
steps are nonuniform, 1.4–3.2k ppm; sanity-banded 0.8–4k); the total is
applied via HSITRIM between frames and mirrored read-only at
`telemetry.clock.trim_steps`. Wire format, qualification rules, and the
tracker's baseline mechanics are normative in protocol §9.3. DES:
`tests/trim.rs` — trains converge/reject/watchdog, the tracker follows
mid-run drift injection, constant seam+skew cancel exactly, solicited
shapes never pair.

## 9. Losslessness

The zero-gap argument, from first principles:

1. **Capture.** Every byte is DMA'd regardless of CPU state; breaks pend
   and may coalesce, but §5 derives frame positions from the stream, so a
   coalesced or delayed wake costs nothing — the fast path recovers every
   completed frame from data.
2. **Backlog.** Bounded by the ring (512 B ≈ 15 minimal hot-loop frames).
   The consumer outruns the wire (~2× worst case); sustained overrun is a
   THROUGHPUT invariant, pinned by the discrete-event flood test
   (`zero_gap_flood` in `hot_loop.rs`: 100 zero-gap minimal writes +
   READ, ring laps ~2×, dispatch-cost sweep inside the contract, zero
   loss at 1M and 3M), not by a runtime guard.
3. **Ordering.** At most one pending-verdict frame at a time (§6), so the
   in-order ring walk preserves frame order. A backlog write commits
   before the frame behind it dispatches — DES-pinned by
   `backlog_write_then_read_processes_in_order`.
4. **The host's side of the contract.** RESPONSE_DEADLINE shall cover the
   full reply path — decode + dispatch + verify, elastically late under a
   backlog — not just the happy-path grid: with ~70 µs dispatch bodies a
   60 µs default is dishonest, and a chain slot reclaims into a
   live-but-slow predecessor (DES-pinned in `hot_loop.rs`). Deployments
   tune the register to their measured worst case.

## 10. Measured turnarounds

Turnaround = instruction wire-end → status break fall. Read = 16 B READ,
write = goal_position 4 B WRITE. Flash-layout swings between builds are
±5 µs.

| baud  | ping    | read 16 B | write 4 B |
|-------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| 0.5M  | 32.2 µs | —         | —         |
| 1M    | 30.4 µs | 38.6 µs   | 87.7 µs   |
| 2M    | 38.8 µs | —         | —         |
| 3M    | 41.3 µs | —         | —         |

Under burst load the elasticity is small: hot-loop mean turnaround at 1M
is 35.4 µs, plain-flood 31.3 µs.

The shape: the reply's tail after the instruction's wire end is
`max(serialized CPU pipeline, reply-gap grid)`. The grid is flat (12 µs
at every baud, protocol §7) and the estimate it hangs off is
delivery-noise-free, so 0.5M/1M pings sit together — grid-bound. 2M/3M
are pipeline-bound: the covered window shrinks below the dispatch body —
at 3M a short frame is fully ringed before the first deadline wake even
fires — so the pipeline serializes after the frame end.

## 11. Glossary

- **break** — line held low ≥ a byte-time; the out-of-band frame
  delimiter. Rings as one 0x00 byte, sets LBD — the transport's only
  receive wake (FE latches too, unserviced). Break framing is the strong
  form of sync: DXL 2.0's `FF FF FD` hunting + byte stuffing is the
  workaround for not having an out-of-band delimiter at all.
- **garble** — line damage that is not a break: a corrupted byte (slot
  occupied, CRC will fail) or a phantom byte (noise-invented byte between
  frames). Raises no wake at all (sub-10-bit lows are invisible to the
  detector, errors never interrupt); dies by data (§5.3).
- **anchor / footprint** — a frame's start index in the ring / its total
  ring length including the break byte.
- **covered span** — everything the CRC protects: the frame minus its two
  trailing CRC bytes.
- **covered checkpoint** — the moment the covered span is fully ringed
  (2 byte-times before frame end); the dispatch point.
- **dispatch (the spine)** — decode + dispatch + reply build performed
  before the CRC verdict — the default for every class, not an
  optimization (§4). Effects STAGE; they do not apply until the verdict.
- **verdict** — the CRC result at the frame end, gating the staged
  effects: the **wire effect** (a staged reply — SEND on pass, DON'T-SEND
  on fail) and the **table effect** (staged writes — COMMIT on pass,
  REVERT on fail). Ping/read stage only wire; a NOREPLY write only table;
  a reply-bearing write both, under one verdict.
- **instruction class** — stageability (§6): *stageable*
  (ping/read/gread/write/gwrite — dispatch inline at HIGH, effects gated
  by the verdict), *verdict-first* (commit/mgmt, CRC checked before
  dispatch).
- **deadline A / B** — header-readable check / frame-end check, both
  ring-cadence projections (`now + missing byte-times`) re-derived at
  every wake (§5).
- **reply gap** — the mandated wire gap between a frame and its reply
  (12 µs, fixed at every baud — host TC→release is time-domain, protocol
  §7); the reply grid.
- **fast path / scheduled path** — §5.2's split: complete-in-ring frames
  resolved from data with no clock / the newest frame timed by deadlines.
- **starve horizon** — 64 byte-times of ring silence on a pending frame;
  the fallback death authority for garble-born candidates (§5.3).
