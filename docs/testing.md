# Testing: the three gears

The transport is verified by three test gears, each proving something the others
structurally cannot. Green across all three — `scripts/gears.sh` — is what lets
us pronounce the tree good.

| gear | proves | where | gate |
|------|--------|-------|------|
| **1 — unit** | the pieces are individually correct: codec, CRC vectors, control-table rules, driver internals | in-crate `#[cfg(test)]` across `firmware/lib/*` and `tools/bench` | CI |
| **2 — DES** | the pieces compose correctly under adversarial sequencing, at every baud, deterministically | `firmware/lib/integration` (discrete-event sim) | CI |
| **3 — bench** | the real silicon meets timing and survives zero-gap load under real ISR/DMA/drift | `tools/bench/tests/hardware` (hardware-in-the-loop) | on-rig |

The division of labour is deliberate. **Gear 2 is wide but blind to time**: the
sim dispatches with a *zero* CPU-time model, so it proves logical correctness and
sequencing at every baud but cannot see ISR latency, wall-clock turnaround, HSI
drift, or the frame-N-deadline-vs-frame-N+1-break window. **Gear 3 is the deep-
on-timing, narrow-on-logic gear**: its whole job is the silicon-only failure
modes gear 2 erases. So for every property the sim is structurally blind to,
gear 3 carries one hardware assertion with a measured budget — it is complete on
silicon-only properties, not on logic.

## Running

```sh
scripts/gears.sh
```

Gears 1 and 2 are deterministic and need no hardware. Gear 3 needs an
osc-adapter with a flashed V006 on its bus; the script auto-detects the adapter
by its USB identity and **skips** gear 3 (rather than failing) when no rig is
attached. Force-skip with `SKIP_BENCH=1`; force-run with `BENCH_FORCE=1`. The
suite targets servo id 1 at the 1 M boot baud by default; override with
`BENCH_ID` / `BENCH_BAUD`.

The gears map to plain cargo invocations if you want to run one directly:

```sh
( cd firmware/lib && cargo test --workspace )            # gear 1 + 2
( cd tools/bench  && cargo test --lib )                  # gear 1 (bench units)
( cd tools/bench  && cargo test --test hardware -- --test-threads=1 )   # gear 3
```

## Gear 3 in detail

The hardware suite drives a flashed V006 through the osc-adapter and asserts
on the wire itself: the adapter's timer captures every edge on the bus pin
(its own TX included) and the bench decodes those edges into byte+tick stamps
host-side, so assertions run on what the wire did, not on what any UART
thinks it heard. No wlink, no chip-counter reads; the wire is the failure
surface. The suite sweeps the full baud matrix (0.5 M / 1 M / 2 M / 3 M).

- **turnaround** (`turnaround.rs`) — THE metric: instruction wire-end → status
  break fall, per baud, gated for ping AND read AND write. 1 M is the tuned
  sweet spot (~35 µs ping); the ceiling is baud-aware because turnaround rises
  at both higher and lower baud on this silicon, and the acked-WRITE gate sits
  near the ~89 µs rules-dominated dispatch floor (the production hot loop pays
  none of it — GWRITE is NOREPLY).
- **rescue** (`rescue.rs`) — the §9.1 pulse reaches a servo at any baud, and
  the full field-recovery flow (rescue → prefix-walk → ASSIGN → SAVE → reboot
  → FACTORY). Both tests end with a rescue-based recovery tail so a transient
  capture dropout never strands the bench unit.
- **trim** (`trim.rs`) - the §9.3 clock discipline on real oscillators: CAL
  trains converge the DUT's trim, the lying-train probe pins plant direction,
  and the host-detune probe (an off-catalog rate one BRR step from nominal)
  exercises the differential tracker.
- **hot loop** (`hot_loop.rs`) — the production `[GWRITE(HOLD), COMMIT, GREAD]`
  zero-gap loop, the silicon twin of the DES `hot_loop` suite. The GREAD shall
  read back the just-committed value every cycle; a stale read-back is a
  silently-dropped frame.
- **plain flood** (`hot_loop.rs`) — an aggressive `[WRITE(NOREPLY) × 8, READ]`
  flood that surfaces the low-baud framer floor.
- **ping / read / write / hold_commit / chain / profile / mgmt / silence** -
  the single-servo instruction set, coordinated reads, and the management
  plane happy paths.

Longer soak: `BENCH_BURST_CYCLES=25000 scripts/gears.sh`.

### The strict burst gate

The burst tests assert **zero failures** — no stale read-backs, no missed or
malformed replies — at every baud, with no tolerance budget. That strictness
is what root-caused the former "low-baud glitch" (a phantom rescue confirm
aliasing data bits, and a CPU DATAR read killing the RX byte mid-reception —
see `osc-servo-transport.md` §7 and `osc-native-protocol.md` §9.1); the
tests went green on their own once the real bugs died, exactly as designed. Keep the gate strict: a red run prints
the exact baud and the `stale` / `no-reply` / `other` breakdown, and the
measurement helpers do not retry, so a first-exchange failure is a real
signal too.

The `tool-*` binaries in `tools/bench/src/bin` are the forensic instruments
behind these tests — `tool-burst` shares the exact cycle engine the hot-loop
test asserts on; `tool-snoop` passively dumps the decoded edge capture when
a wire artifact needs root-causing. Bus operation (discovery, provisioning,
rescue, calibration) is the `osc` CLI's job (`tools/osc`, built on
osc-client), not the bench's.
